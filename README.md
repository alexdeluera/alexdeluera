Trained as a mechanical engineer with a knack for problem-solving and a passion for innovation, I am embarking on an exciting journey to pivot my career towards software development. Armed with a strong analytical mindset and a thirst for knowledge, I am currently immersing myself in the world of programming, mastering Python for its versatility, SQL for database management, and C# for application development. My goal is to leverage my engineering background to create efficient and innovative software solutions that bridge the gap between the physical and digital realms.
